## `fast_eda`

The `fast_eda` package simplifies data exploration by providing key functions for quick insights. The `describe_function()` summarizes numeric columns with statistics like mean and median. The `distribution_plotting_function()` visualizes both categorical and numeric columns using bar charts or histograms. The `counts_function()` identifies missing values in each column. The `correlation_matrix()` generates a correlation matrix between the features in the data frame. FastEDA helps users efficiently explore datasets and identify key patterns with minimal effort.
